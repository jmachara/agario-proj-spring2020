1. Comments to Evaluators:
    Implementation:
            Server started sending circles with no color so I made the players forest green and the food brown.
            Players have their name displayed over them in black letters.
            Splitting shoots the split part where the mouse is. If the main player circle dies, the new main circle will be the first split circle.


    Testing:
            Because it isn't very feasible to unit test the game, I just played around with the game as much as I could on my own and check to see if the functions worked 
            how I wanted them to.

              Comment: My estimates are getting worse because I haven't had a great idea of what the assignments will require until I start them, where
                     as at the beginning of the semester the assignments were very straight forward.
